# Programming with Python template

***Prof. Dr Sven Rahmann***

*Tutors:* Johanna Schmitz

## Getting started

This repository is a template for working throughout the course "Programming with Python (MSc Bioinformatics)". 

You will need to fork this repository into your GitLab account and commit all your work as you go along in the forked repo.

You can add your files for the programming tasks to the *assignments* folder, but the final version must be uplaoded to the CMS.
The later projects must be updated in your fork of this git repository. Further information about the projects will follow along the course.

Failure to comply will result in you not being able to participate in the exams, as we cannot check your results. 


## Folder structure

```
python2024
├── assignments
│   ├── assignments_01.py
│   └── assignments_02.py
├── project_01
│   └── files
└── README.md
```

## Editing this README

After forking, please edit the ```README.md``` file with your name and matriculation number at the top. Please ensure that the correct formatting is used and you have the same data in the CMS, otherwise you will fail.

## Make the git private
When you fork the template, the default visibility is set to "internal".
This means that everyone with a SIC Account can see your repository.
To change this, you should set the visibility to private when you fork the template.
If you already forked the repo, you can change the visibility in the Project settings > general > visibility, project features, permissions > project visibility > private (then save changes).
After setting your repository to private, you need to add the tutors as members.
You can change the members at Manage > Members > Invite members.
The usernames are `rahmann`, `jschmitz` and `zentgraf`. Select for all role `Reporter`

## Ethics and Plagiarism Policy

You may ask for help, either the tutor or other students, or people on the internet, or even books. However, you may not use or copy their code directly. All implementations must be your own. In case you use other peoples' work beyond the Python standard library (e.g. numpy, scipy), this must be clearly stated up-from and properly cited. Violation of these rules will result in removal from the course and in reporting you to the examination office. If you get reported more than once, you may have to leave the university.
